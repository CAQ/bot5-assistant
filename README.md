## Finate State Machine (FSM)

It's a finite state machine, which means it has a finite number of states.

We are trying to use [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) to implement the FSM and using FSM to manage our meeting state transitions.

Currently we are just getting started, you can learn more about the BOT5 Club Meeting FSM at <https://wechaty.github.io/bot5-assistant/>
